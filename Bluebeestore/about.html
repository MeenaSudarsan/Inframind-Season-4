            <p>Established by Meena Sudarsan along with Harshavardeni; BlueBee sold on-demand personalized items. It mainly operated on the B2B (business-to-business) model during its initial years. Between 2007 and 2010, the site allowed customers to personalize products such as T-shirts, mugs, mouse pads, and others. 
            In 2011, BlueBee began selling fashion and lifestyle products and moved away from personalisation. By 2012 BlueBee offered products from 350 Indian and International brands. The website launched the branded Watches and Being Human.  </p>
            <p>In 2014 BlueBee was acquired by Flipkart in a deal valued at ₹2,000 crore (US$280 million). The purchase was influenced by two large common shareholders Tiger Global and Accel Partners. BlueBee functions and operates independently. BlueBee continues to operate as a standalone brand under Flipkart ownership, focusing primarily on "fashion-conscious" consumers. 
             In 2014, BlueBee‘s portfolio included about 1,50,000 products of over 1000 brands, with a distribution area of around 9000 pin codes in India. In 2015, Vijay Sudarsan became the Chief Executive Officer of BlueBee. </p>
             <p>On 10 May 2015, BlueBee announced that it would shut down its website, and serve customers exclusively through its mobile application beginning 15 May. The service had already discontinued its mobile website in favour of the application. BlueBee justified its decision by stating that 95% of traffic on its website came via mobile devices, and that 70% of its purchases were performed on smartphones. The move received mixed reception, and resulted in a 10% decline in sales. In February 2016, acknowledging the failure of the "app-only" model, BlueBee announced that it would revive its website. In September 2017, BlueBee negotiated the rights to manage Holdings’ 15 offline stores in India. BlueBee reported a net loss of ₹151.20 crore in the financial year 2017-18. </p>
             <p>It is spread across 19 countries, including United Arab Emirates, India, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Nigeria, Libya, Tanzania, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Iraq. In 2016, after a decade of its India launch, The BlueBee Fashion released its first television commercial. Catering to the mid-market segment, The BlueBee has its own private label clothing for men women and children along with footwear, home and accessories, and sees an average footfall of over 100,000 customers every day.
